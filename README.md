## Discription 
*  Created a horror movie finder based on four different streaming services.
*  When I click on a streaming service of my choice I am presented with horror movies availible on that streaming service.  
*  Then I am presented with a button to "Get Smashed" that randomizes a cocktail with a photo and lists the ingredients of that cocktail.
*  A option to "Get Smashed" is availible with each movie.
